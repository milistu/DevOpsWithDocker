# MANDATORY EXERCISE 2.3 ðŸ¤”
As we saw previously, starting an application with two programs was not trivial and the commands got a bit long.

In the [previous part](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-1/section-6/) we created Dockerfiles for both [frontend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-backend) of the example application. Next, simplify the usage into one docker-compose.yml.

Configure the backend and frontend from [part 1](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-1/section-6#exercises-111-114) to work in Docker Compose.

Submit the docker-compose.yml

# Solution ðŸ’¡

## 1. Create docker compose file:
_**Note**: Be sure you are placed in directory `./part_2/exercise_03/`._
```bash
cd ../../part_2/exercise_03/
```

```bash
touch docker-compose.yml
```

## 2. Populate the `docker-compose.yml`:
- **Version**: `3.8`

- **Services**:
  - **Backend**:
    - **Image**: `backend-project`
    - **Container Name**: `backend`
    - **Ports**: Maps port `8080` on the host to port `8080` in the container.

  - **Frontend**:
    - **Image**: `frontend-project`
    - **Container Name**: `frontend`
    - **Ports**: Maps port `1000` on the host to port `1000` in the container.

Configures and runs separate containers for backend and frontend projects, accessible on ports `8080` and `1000` of the host, respectively.

## 3. Run docker compose:
```bash
docker compose up
```

## Check the output:
Open you search engine (eg. Chrome) and type `http://127.0.0.1:1000`, you should see this when you press the button:
