# EXERCISE 2.10 ðŸ¤”
Now we have the reverse proxy up and running! All the communication to our app should be done through the reverse proxy and direct access (eg. accessing the backend with a GET to http://localhost:8080/ping ) should be prevented.

Use a port scanner, eg https://hub.docker.com/r/networkstatic/nmap to ensure that there are no extra ports open in the host.

It might be enough to just run

```bash
$ docker run -it --rm --network host networkstatic/nmap localhost
```
If you have an M1/M2 Mac, you might need to build the image yourself.

The result looks like the following (I used a self-built image):
```bash
$ docker run -it --rm --network host nmap localhost
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-03-05 12:28 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.0000040s latency).
Other addresses for localhost (not scanned): ::1
Not shown: 996 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE    SERVICE
80/tcp   filtered http
111/tcp  open     rpcbind
5000/tcp filtered commplex-link
8080/tcp filtered http-proxy

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.28 seconds
```
As we see, there are two suspicious open ports: 5000 and 8080. So it is obvious that the frontend and backend are still directly accessible in the host network. This should be fixed!

You are done when the port scan report looks something like this:
```bash
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-03-05 12:39 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.0000040s latency).
Other addresses for localhost (not scanned): ::1
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT    STATE    SERVICE
80/tcp  filtered http
111/tcp open     rpcbind

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.28 seconds
```
# Solution ðŸ’¡
_**Note**: Be sure you are placed in the directory `./part_2/exercise_10/`._

## 1. Copy the docker-compose file and Nginx config from Exercise 2.9:
_**Note**: Working docker-compose is already present in the directory, these steps only describe to you how we achieved this._

```bash
rsync -av --exclude='README.md' ../exercise_09/ ./
```

## 2. Run docker-compose:
```bash
docker compose up
```

## 3. Check for open ports:
```docker
docker run -it --rm --network host networkstatic/nmap localhost
```
We have some additional ports open:
```bash
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-02-12 16:04 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.0000020s latency).
Other addresses for localhost (not scanned): ::1
Not shown: 995 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE    SERVICE
80/tcp   filtered http
111/tcp  open     rpcbind
1000/tcp filtered cadlock
8080/tcp filtered http-proxy
8083/tcp filtered us-srv

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.34 seconds
```

_**Note**: I have two suspicious open ports: 1000 and 8080, not 5000  because earlier I connected port 1000 to the frontend because my 5000 port was occupied._

## 4. Stop containers:
```bash
docker compose down
```

## 5. Make changes to compose file:

We are going to remove **ports** from **frontend** and **backend** services.

Why does this work?
> Here are two services in a single network: webapp and webapp-helper. The webapp-helper has a server, listening for requests in port 3000, that webapp wants to access. Because they were defined in the same docker-compose.yml file the access is trivial. Docker Compose has already taken care of creating a network and webapp can simply send a request to webapp-helper:3000, the internal DNS will translate that to the correct access and ports do not have to be published outside of the network.

[Link to quoted chapter](https://devopswithdocker.com/part-2/section-2/#:~:text=Here%20are%20two,of%20the%20network.).

## 6. Run docker-compose:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

_**Note**: We are setting a `--build` argument to be sure that our images are up to date and for changes in frontend image to take effect. `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` is a build argument and we need to make sure that no previous builds were left behind._


## 7. Check for open ports:
```docker
docker run -it --rm --network host networkstatic/nmap localhost
```
Output:

```bash
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-02-20 18:42 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.0000010s latency).
Other addresses for localhost (not scanned): ::1
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT    STATE    SERVICE
80/tcp  filtered http
111/tcp open     rpcbind

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.35 seconds
```

Same as requested from the exercise! ðŸ‘Œ

## Cleanup ðŸ§¹
Remove docker containers:
```bash
docker compose down
```
