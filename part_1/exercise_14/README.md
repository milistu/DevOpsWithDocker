# MANDATORY EXERCISE 1.14: ENVIRONMENT ðŸ¤”
Start both frontend-example and backend-example with correct ports exposed and add ENV to Dockerfile with necessary information from both READMEs ([front](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-frontend), [back](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-backend)).

Ignore the backend configurations until frontend sends requests to `_backend_url_/ping` when you press the button.

You know that the configuration is ready when the button for 1.14 of frontend-example responds and turns green.

Do not alter the code of either project

Submit the edited Dockerfiles and commands used to run.

The frontend will first talk to your browser. Then the code will be executed from your browser and that will send a message to backend.

- TIP: When configuring web applications keep browser developer console ALWAYS open, F12 or cmd+shift+I when the browser window is open. Information about configuring cross origin requests is in README of the backend project.

- TIP: Developer console has multiple views, most important ones are Console and Network. Exploring the Network tab can give you a lot of information on where messages are being sent and what is received as response!

## Solution ðŸ’¡

1. We need to add ENV variable in both frontend and backend Dockerfile.

    In frontend Dockerfile (Exercise 12) we need to add:

    ```Dockerfile
    ENV REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
    ```
    And, in backend Dockerfile (Exercise 13) we need to add:

    ```Dockerfile
    ENV REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost:1000
    ```

    _**Note**: Previous lines of code are already added in Dockerfiles._

2. Start both backend and frontend containers:

    Start backend container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 backend-project
    ```

    Start frontend container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 127.0.0.1:1000:1000 frontend-project
    ```

3. Open you search engine (eg. Chrome) and type `http://127.0.0.1:1000`, you should see this when you press the button:

4. After we verified that everything works we can now delete the "example-frontend" and "example-backend" from previous exercises so we don't waste space:

    _**Note**: Be shure you are in directory `part_1/exercise_14/`_

    ```bash
    rm -r ../exercise_12/example-frontend ../exercise_13/example-backend
    ```
