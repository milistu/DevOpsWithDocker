# EXERCISE 1.9: VOLUMES ðŸ¤”
In this exercise, we won't create a new Dockerfile.

Image `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` creates a timestamp every two seconds to `/usr/src/app/text.log` when it's not given a command. Start the container with a bind mount so that the logs are created into your filesystem.

Submit the command you used to complete the exercise.

__Hint:__ read the note that was made just before this exercise!

# Solution ðŸ’¡

## 1. Create a `.log` file:
> Note: also that -v creates a **directory** if the file does not exist.

We do not want a directory, we want a file so that is why we need to manually create one.
```bash
touch text.log
```

## 2. Run container:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/text.log:/usr/src/app/text.log" devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service
```
