# EXERCISE 1.8: TWO LINE DOCKERFILE ðŸ¤”
By default our `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine` doesn't have a CMD.

Instead, it uses ENTRYPOINT to declare which application is run.

We'll talk more about ENTRYPOINT in the next section, but you already know that the last argument in `docker run` can be used to give a command or an argument.

As you might've noticed it doesn't start the web service even though the name is "simple-web-service". A suitable argument is needed to start the server!

Try `docker run devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine hello`. The application reads the argument "hello" but will inform that hello isn't accepted.

In this exercise create a Dockerfile and use FROM and CMD to create a brand new image that automatically runs `server`.

The Docker documentation [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) says a bit indirectly that if an image has ENTRYPOINT defined, CMD is used to define it the default arguments.

Tag the new image as "web-server"

Return the Dockerfile and the command you used to run the container.

Running the built "web-server" image should look like this:

```bash
$ docker run web-server
[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Creating an Engine instance with the Logger and Recovery middleware already attached.

[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Running in "debug" mode. Switch to "release" mode in production.
- using env:   export GIN_MODE=release
- using code:  gin.SetMode(gin.ReleaseMode)

[GIN-debug] GET    /*path                    --> server.Start.func1 (3 handlers)
[GIN-debug] Listening and serving HTTP on :8080
```

- We don't have any method of accessing the web service yet. As such confirming that the console output is the same will suffice.

- The exercise title may be a useful hint here.

# Solution ðŸ’¡

## 1. Create and populate `Dockerfile`:
```Dockerfile
FROM devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine

CMD server
```

## 2. Build the image:

_**Note**: Be sure you are in the directory containing `Dockerfile`_

```bash
docker build . -t web-server
```
    
## 3. Run container:
```bash
docker run --rm web-server
```

## __*Output:*__

```bash
[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Running in "debug" mode. Switch to "release" mode in production.
 - using env:	export GIN_MODE=release
 - using code:	gin.SetMode(gin.ReleaseMode)

[GIN-debug] GET    /*path                    --> server.Start.func1 (3 handlers)
[GIN-debug] Listening and serving HTTP on :8080
```
