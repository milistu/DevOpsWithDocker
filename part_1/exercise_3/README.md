# EXERCISE 1.3: SECRET MESSAGE ðŸ¤”
Now that we've warmed up it's time to get inside a container while it's running!

Image `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu` will start a container that outputs logs into a file. Go inside the container and use `tail -f ./text.log` to follow the logs. Every 10 seconds the clock will send you a "secret message".

Submit the secret message and command(s) given as your answer.

## Solution ðŸ’¡

1. Create a container:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name web-service devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu
    ```
    
2. Access container with input privileges

    ```bash
    docker exec -it web-service bash
    ```

3. Read "secret message": 

    ```bash
    tail -f ./text.log
    ```

__*Secret message:*__

```bash
Secret message is: 'You can find the source code here: https://github.com/docker-hy'
